        <h2>Kimchi, a living legend</h2>
        <p>Kimchi is a fermented dish, meaning that it contains -- and indeed is "cooked" by -- good bacteria. 
            These live cultures are great for your gut...and overall health! 
            While fermentation might seem daunting to some, don't be afraid to play around with this recipe.
            As long as you keep exposure to oxygen to a minimum, you'll create the right
            environment for the bacteria you want to ferment this cabbage-based dish.</p> 

        <h2>How to make tangy kimchi</h2>
        <p>This recipe will give you the base. But, feel free to increase the amount of chili, if you like spice,
            or even omit certain ingredients entirely, if like me, you're sensitve to garlic.

            <li>1 cup <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/ingredient/gochugaru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gochugaru (hot pepper flakes)</a></li>
            <li>6 ounces <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/ingredient/korean-radish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Korean radish</a> or <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/ingredient/daikon-radish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daikon radish</a>, 
            cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>6 green onions, sliced diagonally</li>
            <li>2 ounces carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters, and remove the core. Cut horizontally into 1 inch pieces, and place in a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Toss with 6 tablespoons of salt and 1 cup of water. Let stand for 2 hours, tossing every 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small sauce pan, combine the sweet rice flour and 1 cup of water. Place over medium high heat and stir until it begins to bubble and thicken. Turn down the heat to medium and continue to stir until transluscent (approximately 7 minutes).
                Remove from heat and let cool.
            </li>
            <li>Put the thickened rice flour paste, remaining 3 tablespoons of salt, half an apple, garlic, ginger and onion in a food processer. Blend to a puree. Add the gochu-garu</li>
            <li>Return to your cabbage. Drain and thoroughly wash off the salt using cool water. Drain well, squeezing out any excess water.</li>
            <li>Place the cabbage, radish matchsticks, green onion, and carrot matchsticks in a bowl. Add the kimchi paste and mix together.</li>
            <li>Transfer to an airtight container, pressing the kimchi down to make sure there are no air pockets. Cover the top with a layer of seran wrap, and close the lid tightly.</li>
            <li>Let sit at room temperature for 1 to 3 days, releasing any built up air and pressing down the kimchi every day. Taste it to check if it's fermented enough, and when it is, store it in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
