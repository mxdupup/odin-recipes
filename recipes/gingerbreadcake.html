        <h2>It might not be a man...but it just might be better, cake!</h2>
        <p>The classic gingerbread man gets a mean update in this rich and moist cake.
            This cake is not without a kick, packed with three types of ginger: dried, fresh, and crystalized.
        </p>

        <p>To top it all off, you can make this a rich winter treat, topped with whipped cream and nuts.</p>

        <h2>How to make this spicy gingerbread cake</h2>
        <p>Spicy may not be the most common descriptor for a cake. But, with three types of ginger, this cake does pack a punch.
            If that's not your thing, you can always cut down the ginger (especially the fresh ginger), or if it really, <em>really</em> is, 
            throw in a bit more!
        </p>
        <p>On the bright side, the whipped cream helps balance out any spice, making this a rich, and festive, treat.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dark corn syrup</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 ounce knob of fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>3/4 cup crystalized ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>optional, 3/4 cup walnuts, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup whipping cream, chilled</li>
            <li>optional, 1/4 cup pomegranate seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Butter and line an 8-inch round cake pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add molasses, corn syrup, egg, and salt, and beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and dried ginger together.</li>
            <li>Fold half of the flour mixture into the butter and sugar. Then add half the butter milk and mix. Repeat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the freash ginger, 1/2 cup of crystalized ginger, and 1/2 cup of walnuts, if using.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>While the cake is cooling, whip the whipped cream until it holds stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Spread the whipped cream over the cake. (You can optionally cut the cake horizontally in half to create two layers.) Decorate the cake with the remaining 1/4 cup of crystalized ginger, 1/4 cup of walnuts, and pomegranate seeds.</li>
        </ol>
