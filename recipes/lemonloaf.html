        <h2>Lemon loaf or lemon drizzle cake?</h2>
        <p>Both names would be correct. We like to make this zesty cake in loaf form, 
            as it travels well. With minimal -- or no -- frosting, 
            you can easily wrap it in plastic wrap for an easily transportable cake.
        </p>
        <p>But, don't forget the drizzle. That's what gives this loaf such it's tart
            and bright flavor. It's also what makes this cake so tasty...no frosting needed.

            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lemon drizzle</h4>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>Put the sugar in a mixing bowl. Zest the lemons over the top.
                Gently rub the zest into the sugar, releasing the oils and fragrance.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease and ine a loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Juice the lemons into the sugar and zest. Add the butter, and cream butter and sugar. 
                Crack in the eggs one at a time.</li>
            <li>Fold in half of the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>Gently mix in the milk.</li>
            <li>Fold in the remaining flour, being sure not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to the loaf pan, shaking to smooth.</li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes in the pan.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine the sugar and lemon juice for the drizzle in a small sauce pan.
                Slowly heat over low heat, stirring, until the sugar desolves.
            </li>
            <li>After the cake has cooled for 5 minutes, use a toothpick or skewer to poke holes all over the cake.
                Ladle the lemon drizzle topping all over the cake, allowing it to soak in.
            </li>
            <li>Let the cake finish cooling to room temperature before removing from pan. Serve plain or with berries.</li>
        </ol>
