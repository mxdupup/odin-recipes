About the project

This was created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. It showcases my new html skill, featuring: 
- links (authortative and relative)
- images
- multiple pages
- lists (ordered and unordered).

In the second iteration, I added css elements, mainly focused on:
- colors
- fonts, text size, and text alignment
- image size and placement.

Note on use:

The Gingerbread Cake recipe is genuinely delicious. Good luck with the other two, I've never tried them.
